# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** Personal camping second brain — a closed-loop system that plans, executes, and learns from every trip
**Current focus:** Phase 20 — live-location-sharing

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (live-location-sharing) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-03

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 14 (v1.0 phases 2-5)
- Average duration: ~10 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~2.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02 Executive Trip Prep | 2 | ~21 min | ~10 min |
| 03 Knowledge Base | 4 | ~65 min | ~16 min |
| 04 Chat Agent | 4 | ~27 min | ~7 min |
| 05 Intelligence Features | 4 | ~12 min | ~3 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 4, 4, 15, 4, 3 (Phase 05)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 Research]: "Leaving Now" snapshot must use IndexedDB — not service worker response caching
- [v1.1 Research]: Learning loop must append to TripFeedback model — never mutate GearItem source records
- [v1.1 Research]: Use Zod .safeParse() not .parse() — return 422 for schema mismatches, not 500
- [v1.1 Research]: Manual public/sw.js preferred over Serwist — avoids Webpack/Turbopack conflict
- [v1.1 Research]: Schema migration (PackingItem usage fields + TripFeedback) belongs in Phase 6 to unblock Phase 9
- [Phase 05]: VoiceRecordModal manages full state machine — voice debrief infrastructure already exists for Phase 9 to wire up
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: MealPlan uses @unique on tripId (one per trip); TripFeedback uses @@index (append-only, never @unique) per D-05/D-09
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: parseClaudeJSON<T> uses Zod .safeParse() returning discriminated union, never throws; strips markdown fences before parsing (D-13)
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: parseClaudeJSON wraps all Claude response parsing in API routes — 422 for schema mismatch, 500 for other errors
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: AI results persist on generation and load on component mount — packing lists to Trip.packingListResult, meal plans to MealPlan model via upsert
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: Packing list PUT is fire-and-forget in component -- user sees item locally even if server write fails
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: TripCard extracted to standalone file — PackingList/MealPlan child state no longer destroyed on parent re-render
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: SpotMap photo delete uses onPhotoDeleted callback instead of window.location.reload() — map zoom/center preserved
- [Phase 06-stabilization]: Both PackingList and MealPlan guard regenerate with ConfirmDialog — first-time generation skips confirm
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: Settings singleton uses hardcoded id='user_settings' — enforces one row, upsert always targets same record
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: sendFloatPlan uses text field not html — plain text ensures newlines render correctly in all email clients
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: FTS virtual tables not managed by Prisma — migration SQL manually corrected to remove DROP TABLE for non-existent tables
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: PATCH check-off wrapped in prisma.$transaction — prevents race conditions on rapid sequential taps
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: Departure section in TripPrepClient fetches departure checklist independently — not through /api/trips/[id]/prep
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: composeFloatPlanEmail includes checklistStatus parameter — emergency contact sees departure preparation level (X of Y tasks completed)
- [Phase 07-day-of-execution]: FloatPlanLog uses fire-and-forget .catch() — database log failure never blocks email send confirmation
- [Phase 13-address-review-findings]: safeParseFloat/safeParseInt return null not NaN — correct for Prisma nullable fields
- [Phase 13-address-review-findings]: vehicle/[id] PUT now explicitly maps fields — removes unsafe pass-through of raw request body to Prisma
- [Phase 13]: All 74 Gemini findings accounted for — 27 fixed, 8 already handled, 10 deferred MEDIUM, 31 deferred LOW
- [Phase 20-live-location-sharing]: SharedLocation uses singleton pattern (findFirst + create/update) — same approach as Settings model; one shared location at a time
- [Phase 20-live-location-sharing]: upsertSharedLocation/deleteSharedLocation accept prismaClient argument — pure helpers testable without real DB
- [Phase 20-live-location-sharing]: ssr:false dynamic import must live in Client Component — extracted to share-page-client.tsx; Server Components cannot use ssr:false in Next.js 16 App Router
- [Phase 20-live-location-sharing]: Cloudflare Tunnel config routes only /share/* and /api/share/location/* publicly — main app stays Tailscale-only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Serwist/Turbopack: if manual sw.js fails App Router URL pattern validation in spike, fall back to Serwist with --webpack flag
- Voice debrief extraction schema needs a prompt engineering spike before Phase 9 UI is built
- iOS 7-day storage clearing: surface snapshot age clearly in the UI (Phase 8)
