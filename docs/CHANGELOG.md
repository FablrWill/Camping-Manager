# Changelog

All notable changes to Outland OS are tracked here.

## 2026-03-30 — Session 9: Audit + Weather Integration + Smart Campsite

### Created
- `docs/AUDIT.md` — Top-to-bottom project audit: code quality, docs consistency, open source research (Open-Meteo, RIDB, NPS, GPX tools, Serwist PWA), Google integration analysis, PWA vs native hardware access, 5 creative feature ideas, implementation plan
- `lib/weather.ts` — Open-Meteo API client. WMO weather code mapping, unit conversion (metric→imperial), smart camping alerts: rain, cold, heat, wind, UV with severity levels
- `components/WeatherCard.tsx` — Compact forecast display: day grid with emoji/high/low/precip, expandable details (wind, UV, sunrise/sunset), alert strips, loading skeleton, error state
- `app/api/weather/route.ts` — GET endpoint with input validation, date format checks, 1-hour cache header

### Changed
- `components/TripsClient.tsx` — Auto-fetches weather for upcoming trips with GPS locations. WeatherCard displayed inline on trip cards. Replaced `alert()` with inline error state.
- `app/trips/page.tsx` — Now passes location GPS coordinates to client
- `app/api/trips/route.ts` — Added try-catch + validation, returns location lat/lon
- `app/api/vehicle/route.ts` — Added try-catch + validation
- `app/api/vehicle/[id]/route.ts` — Added try-catch to GET and PUT
- `app/api/vehicle/[id]/mods/route.ts` — Added try-catch + validation
- `app/api/timeline/route.ts` — Wrapped Promise.all in try-catch
- `.env.example` — Updated: Claude API key moved up, weather note (Open-Meteo, no key needed)
- `docs/FEATURE-PHASES.md` — Smart Campsite section added to Phase 3
- `TASKS.md` — Weather marked done, smart campsite subtasks added, blockers updated

### Key Decisions
- **Open-Meteo over OpenWeatherMap** — free, no API key, better camping data (wind, UV, solar radiation, soil temp). Eliminates a blocker.
- **Smart devices extend gear model** — `isSmartDevice` flag + connection metadata, all nullable. Not a separate feature.
- **HA as control plane** — app adds camping context on top. App never talks to devices directly.
- **PWA for now, native later if needed** — camera, GPS, mic, offline all work in PWA. Only Bluetooth (EcoFlow) and background GPS require native.

### Status at End of Session
- Weather integration complete and working
- All API routes now have error handling
- Claude API key configured, no blockers for Phase 2
- Next: Claude API packing list generator (task #2 in Up Next)

## 2026-03-30 — Session 8: Merge All Branches + App Rename

### No Code Written — Integration & Housekeeping

### What We Did
- Reviewed all parallel session output and identified gaps
- Merged 3 branches into main: KB architecture session, `pedantic-hellman` (frontend), `thirsty-hawking` (planning)
- Resolved TASKS.md conflict: user journey priorities win over KB and frontend session priorities
- Added trip prep component specs to STYLE-GUIDE.md (weather card, packing list, meal plan, power budget, AI response patterns, trip prep flow layout)
- Reviewed and confirmed TripsClient.tsx as a solid foundation — one noted gap (all trip cards need to be tappable, not just past trips)
- **Renamed app from "Camp Commander" to "Outland OS"** — updated all source files, docs, scripts, seed data, style guide, and plans

### Files Updated
- All `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.md`, `*.py` in project root — "Camp Commander" → "Outland OS"
- `docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md` — added full trip prep component spec section
- `TASKS.md` — final resolved priorities from merged branches
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/STATUS.md` — session history updated

### Key Decision
- **Outland OS** — new app name, effective immediately

### Status at End of Session
- main is clean and up to date
- All branches merged
- Next: get Claude API key + OpenWeatherMap key, then build weather integration (TASKS.md #1)

---

## 2026-03-30 — Session 7: User Journey + Roadmap Rewrite

### No Code Written — Planning Session

### What We Did
- Will completed a voice interview with an LLM to define the primary user loop
- Defined before/during/after trip experience
- Identified must-have features vs. nice-to-haves
- Set a clear "definition of done enough"
- Rewrote TASKS.md and FEATURE-PHASES.md based on the output

### Key Decisions
- **Phase 3 AI features pulled forward** — packing list, meal planning, weather are now Phase 2 must-haves
- **Trip creation UI is the immediate next task** — it's the anchor for all trip prep features
- **Claude API key is now a blocker** — needed to start building the core value
- **Timeline/path animation deprioritized** — great work, not core to the user journey
- **Vehicle profile page is low priority** — data exists, page can wait

### Files Created/Updated
- `docs/USER-JOURNEY.md` — new file, captures the voice interview output
- `docs/FEATURE-PHASES.md` — full rewrite with new priorities
- `TASKS.md` — new "Up Next" aligned to user journey

### Status at End of Session
- Roadmap is clear. Next build session starts with trip creation UI.
- See `docs/USER-JOURNEY.md` for the north star.

## 2026-03-30 — Session 6: Frontend Design System & Page Build-Out

### Created
- **Style Guide** (`docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md`) — comprehensive design system: color tokens (light + dark), typography scale, spacing grid, component specs, navigation patterns, accessibility guidelines
- **CSS Design Tokens** (`globals.css`) — CSS custom properties for all colors/shadows/radii, `.dark` class overrides, animations (slide-up, fade-in), skeleton loading, safe area support
- **UI Component Library** (`components/ui/`):
  - `Button` — 4 variants (primary/secondary/danger/ghost), 3 sizes, loading spinner
  - `Card` + `CardHeader` + `CardTitle` + `CardDescription` — flexible card containers
  - `Badge` — 8 variants including condition-mapped colors
  - `Input` + `Textarea` + `Select` — form primitives with labels, errors, hints
  - `Modal` + `ConfirmDialog` — bottom sheet (mobile) / centered (desktop)
  - `Chip` + `ChipRow` — filter chips with scrollable container
  - `EmptyState` — emoji + message + optional CTA
  - `PageHeader` — title + subtitle + action slot
  - `StatCard` — metric display with icon + label + value + subtext
- **ThemeProvider** — React context for dark mode: respects `prefers-color-scheme`, persists to `localStorage`, no flash of wrong theme via inline script
- **Bottom Navigation** (`BottomNav.tsx`) — 5-tab bar with Lucide icons, active state highlighting, iPhone safe area padding
- **Top Header** (`TopHeader.tsx`) — glassmorphic blur header with dynamic page title + dark mode toggle
- **AppShell** — wraps ThemeProvider + TopHeader + BottomNav around all pages
- **Dashboard** (`DashboardClient.tsx`) — live stats grid (gear count/weight, spots/photos, vehicle, trips), wishlist callout, recent gear, quick action grid
- **Vehicle Page** — hero card with gradient, specs list (fuel economy, clearance, towing), expandable cargo dimensions, mods CRUD with cost/date tracking
- **Trips Page** — trip creation form (name, dates, location, vehicle, notes), upcoming/past sections, countdown timer, active trip ribbon, night count
- **Vehicle API** — GET/POST vehicles, GET/PUT single vehicle, POST mods

### Changed
- Root `layout.tsx` — removed old top nav bar, added theme-aware `<html>` class, viewport-fit cover for iPhone, theme-color meta tags
- Home `page.tsx` — now server component fetching live DB stats instead of static cards
- `GearClient.tsx` — full dark mode support across toggle, search, chips, cards, empty state, delete confirmation
- `GearForm.tsx` — dark mode on all form inputs, labels, buttons, modal chrome
- Installed `lucide-react` for consistent icon system

### Design Decisions
- **Bottom nav over top nav** — standard mobile pattern, keeps thumb in reach zone, frees top for context-specific info
- **Stone/amber palette** — earthy, warm, outdoor-appropriate. Stone for neutrals, amber for accents/CTAs
- **Dark mode from day one** — camping at night means red-shifted UI matters. Full dark theme with system preference detection.
- **Component library** — reusable primitives ensure consistency as pages multiply. Not over-abstracted — just the patterns we use repeatedly.
- **System fonts** — no external font loads. Performance > aesthetics for a tool app.

## 2026-03-29 — Session 1: Project Kickoff

### Created
- Project directory structure (app, components, lib, prisma, public, docs)
- `CLAUDE.md` — project-level instructions for Claude Code
- `docs/PLAN.md` — full project plan with 4 phases and 6 core modules
- `docs/vehicle-profile.md` — 2022 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid specs and camping notes
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — this file
- `docs/STATUS.md` — current status and session handoff doc
- `docs/GOALS.md` — project goals and success criteria

### Decisions Made
- **Tech stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind + SQLite/Prisma + TypeScript
- **Maps:** Google Maps (Will is familiar with it)
- **AI:** Claude API for gear identification and conversational agent
- **Deployment:** Local dev first, Vercel later
- **No auth:** Single-user personal tool

### Status at End of Session
- See `docs/STATUS.md` for pickup instructions

## 2026-03-29 — Session 2: Foundation Build

### Created
- Next.js 16 app with TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router (Turbopack)
- Prisma schema with 6 models: GearItem, Vehicle, VehicleMod, Location, Trip, PackingItem
- SQLite database with initial migration
- Mobile-responsive layout shell with sticky nav (stone/amber theme)
- Home page with 4 module cards (Gear, Vehicle, Spots, Trips)
- Database seed script (`prisma/seed.ts`) — genesis spot + Santa Fe vehicle
- Prisma client singleton (`lib/db.ts`)
- Genesis spot photos saved to `00_Context/photos/genesis-spot/`

### Data Seeded
- **Location:** South Rim of Linville Gorge (35.8783, -81.9094) — dispersed, rated 5/5, Starlink strong, cell weak
- **Vehicle:** 2022 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid — full specs from vehicle-profile.md

### Feature Ideas Captured
- **User Guide Finder** — auto-search and save product manuals when adding gear (added to PLAN.md)
- **Voice Ghostwriter** — voice-first journaling, agent interviews you and drafts the entry (added to IDEAS.md)

### Decisions Made
- **SQLite for now** — Prisma makes the switch to Postgres a one-liner when deploying to Vercel
- **Build for scale** — no shortcuts that need rework later; forward-compatible architecture choices
- **Large media excluded from git** — MOV/HEIC/MP4 in .gitignore, only PNGs committed
- **EXIF extraction works** — GPS coords confirmed from iPhone 14 Pro videos; will auto-extract location from photos in Phase 2
- **Branching strategy** — main stays stable, feature branches for development going forward

### Status at End of Session
- Phase 1 foundation complete
- Next: gear inventory CRUD, vehicle profile page
- See `docs/STATUS.md` for pickup instructions

## 2026-03-30 — Session 3: Photo Map

### Created
- `Photo` model in Prisma schema (latitude, longitude, altitude, takenAt, imagePath)
- `/spots` page — full-screen Leaflet/OpenStreetMap map, no Google API key required
- `components/SpotMap.tsx` — Leaflet map with custom pins, clustering, click popups
- `components/PhotoUpload.tsx` — drag-drop / camera roll upload with GPS feedback
- `app/api/photos/upload/route.ts` — EXIF GPS extraction + sharp compression (~100KB)
- `app/api/photos/route.ts` — list photos for client-side refresh
- `lib/exif.ts` — EXIF GPS parser utility
- Leaflet/OpenStreetMap markers: amber camera pins (photos) + green location pins (spots)

### Changed
- `app/layout.tsx` — Spots nav link updated to `/spots`, removed max-width from main (map needs full width)
- `app/page.tsx` — Spots card link updated to `/spots`, added container padding directly

### Dependencies Added
- `leaflet`, `@types/leaflet` — map rendering (raw Leaflet API, not react-leaflet wrapper)
- `exif-parser` — EXIF GPS extraction
- `sharp` — image compression

### Decisions Made
- **Leaflet/OpenStreetMap** over Google Maps — free, no API key, no rate limits; sufficient for personal use
- **Store compressed copy locally** (~100KB JPEG) — avoids Google Photos link complexity, works offline
- **No Google Takeout pipeline** — direct phone upload is simpler; can add bulk import later if needed
- **Server component for data, client component for map** — Leaflet needs browser `window`, handled via dynamic import

### Status at End of Session
- Phase 2 photo map complete
- Linville Gorge pin visible on load; upload geotagged photos to add pins
- Next: location save/edit with pin drop, gear inventory CRUD
- See `docs/STATUS.md` for pickup instructions

## 2026-03-30 — Session 4: Interactive Timeline Map + Google Takeout Import

### Created
- `tools/photo-map/extract_photos.py` — Extract GPS metadata from Google Photos Takeout sidecars
- `tools/photo-map/extract_timeline.py` — Extract GPS path + place visits from Location History (streaming parser for large files)
- `tools/photo-map/enrich_screenshots.py` — Claude Sonnet vision AI identifies locations from map screenshots
- `tools/photo-map/README.md` — Full setup guide, usage, troubleshooting
- `app/api/import/photos/route.ts` — Bulk import photos from Takeout JSON
- `app/api/import/timeline/route.ts` — Bulk import timeline data (path points, place visits, activity segments)
- `app/api/timeline/route.ts` — Serve timeline data to frontend with date filtering
- Prisma models: `TimelinePoint`, `PlaceVisit`, `ActivitySegment`
- Migration: `add_timeline_models_and_photo_enhancements`

### Changed
- `components/SpotMap.tsx` — Complete rewrite: marker clustering (leaflet.markercluster), color-coded activity path polylines, place visit markers with pulse animation, dark mode tiles (CartoDB Dark Matter), layer toggles, path animation with speed control, forwardRef for imperative API
- `app/spots/spots-client.tsx` — Added: day picker with date filtering, day summary card, layer toggles (photos/spots/path/places), animation controls (play/stop/speed slider), dark mode toggle, timeline data fetching, unplaced photos count
- `app/spots/page.tsx` — Queries new Photo fields (locationSource, locationConfidence, visionApproximate, googleUrl)
- `app/api/photos/route.ts` — Returns new enrichment fields
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Photo model: nullable lat/lon, locationSource, locationDescription, locationConfidence, visionApproximate, googleUrl fields

### Dependencies Changed
- Added: `leaflet.markercluster`, `@types/leaflet.markercluster`
- Removed: `react-leaflet`, `react-leaflet-cluster` (unused — SpotMap uses raw Leaflet API)

### Decisions Made
- **Google Takeout import** added alongside direct upload — both approaches supported now
- **Timeline data in SQLite** — bulk import via API, not parsed on-the-fly in the browser
- **tools/ directory** for standalone Python scripts — keeps Next.js app root clean
- **Activity color coding** — hiking=green, driving=red, cycling=blue, kayaking=teal, flying=purple
- **Photo marker colors** by source — blue=EXIF GPS, green=vision exact, orange=vision approximate

### Status at End of Session
- Timeline visualization fully working on /spots page
- Python extraction tools ready for Google Takeout data
- Next: location save/edit, gear inventory CRUD, or start using real Takeout data
- See `docs/STATUS.md` for pickup instructions

## 2026-03-30 — Session 7: User Journey + Roadmap Rewrite

### No Code Written — Planning Session

### What We Did
- Will completed a voice interview with an LLM to define the primary user loop
- Defined before/during/after trip experience
- Identified must-have features vs. nice-to-haves
- Set a clear "definition of done enough"
- Rewrote TASKS.md and FEATURE-PHASES.md based on the output

### Key Decisions
- **Phase 3 AI features pulled forward** — packing list, meal planning, weather are now Phase 2 must-haves
- **Trip creation UI is the immediate next task** — it's the anchor for all trip prep features
- **Claude API key is now a blocker** — needed to start building the core value
- **Timeline/path animation deprioritized** — great work, not core to the user journey
- **Vehicle profile page is low priority** — data exists, page can wait

### Files Created/Updated
- `docs/USER-JOURNEY.md` — new file, captures the voice interview output
- `docs/FEATURE-PHASES.md` — full rewrite with new priorities
- `TASKS.md` — new "Up Next" aligned to user journey

### Status at End of Session
- Roadmap is clear. Next build session starts with trip creation UI.
- See `docs/USER-JOURNEY.md` for the north star.

## 2026-03-30 — Session 6: Project Review + Planning Pause

### No Code Written — Planning Session

### What We Did
- Full project critique: reviewed all 5 sessions of work against the original goals
- Identified the core gap: the app has modules (gear, map, photos) but no coherent user journey
- Identified scope creep: Google Takeout timeline visualization is impressive but not the priority
- Identified that Phase 3 (AI/Claude API) is the whole point — and it's untouched
- Wrote a voice interview prompt for Will to use with an LLM to define the user journey

### Key Findings
- **Missing:** A primary loop — what does Will *do* with this app before/during/after a trip?
- **Missing:** The Trip model has been in the DB since Session 2 but has no UI
- **Premature:** Timeline/path animation was built before the core trip flow
- **Untouched:** All Phase 3 AI features, which are the actual value proposition
- **Risk:** Parallel frontend design session may be designing screens for an undefined flow

### Decision Made
- Pause feature building
- Will is doing a voice interview with an LLM to define the user journey
- Output: a structured document with must-haves, nice-to-haves, and definition of "done enough"
- That document will be used to rewrite the roadmap before next build session

### Status at End of Session
- No code changes — working tree clean
- Next: Will brings back user journey doc → rewrite TASKS.md + FEATURE-PHASES.md → resume building with clear direction

---

## 2026-03-30 — Session 5: Location Pin Drop + Gear CRUD

### Created
- `components/LocationForm.tsx` — mobile-friendly slide-up form for creating/editing locations. Fields: name, date/time visited, type, star rating, road condition, clearance, cell/Starlink signal, water access, description, notes.
- `app/api/locations/route.ts` — GET all locations, POST create new location
- `app/api/locations/[id]/route.ts` — GET single, PUT update, DELETE location
- Prisma migration: `add_visited_at_to_location` — adds `visitedAt DateTime?` to Location model
- Gear inventory CRUD (built in parallel session) — list, add, edit, delete gear items

### Changed
- `components/SpotMap.tsx` — Added `onLocationEdit` callback prop, Edit button in location popups, expanded `MapLocation` interface with all Location fields
- `app/spots/spots-client.tsx` — Map click → LocationForm with lat/lng pre-filled, edit existing locations via popup Edit button, location state management with API refresh
- `app/spots/page.tsx` — Fetches all Location fields (not just map subset), serializes visitedAt/createdAt/updatedAt
- `TASKS.md` — Marked gear CRUD + location pin drop done, added nearby trails API task, updated Up Next

### Decisions Made
- **visitedAt field** — like Google Photos info panel, lets you record when you visited, not just when you saved
- **Slide-up panel** over modal — better mobile UX, doesn't obscure map completely
- **Nearby trails API** planned for Phase 3 — will use OSM Overpass, NPS, Recreation.gov, USDA Forest Service (no AllTrails/Wikiloc APIs available)

### Status at End of Session
- Location save/edit fully working on /spots page
- Gear CRUD built in parallel session
- Next: vehicle profile page, auto-tag photos, basic trip creation

## 2026-03-30 — Session 6: Knowledge Base Architecture + Corpus Organization

### Planned
- Full RAG architecture for NC camping knowledge base
- Hybrid retrieval: Vectra (vector/semantic) + SQLite FTS5 (keyword)
- Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small at 512 dimensions, 800-token chunks with 100-token overlap
- PDF ingestion pipeline: pdf-parse → chunk → embed → store
- Chat interface: Claude Sonnet with streaming, source citations, conversation history
- 5 new Prisma models: KnowledgeSource, KnowledgeChunk, ChatConversation, ChatMessage + FTS5 virtual table
- New dependencies: @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai, vectra, pdf-parse, tiktoken
- Full plan saved to `/Users/willis/.claude/plans/harmonic-watching-crown.md`

### Created
- `data/research/` — knowledge base corpus (7 markdown files, cleaned + frontmatted)
  - `bear-safety-lnt.md` — Bear safety + Leave No Trace in NC
  - `campgrounds-by-region.md` — Best campgrounds statewide
  - `campgrounds-asheville-3hr-radius.md` — Best spots within 3hrs of Asheville
  - `dispersed-camping-regulations.md` — Dispersed camping rules across all NC public lands
  - `forest-road-access.md` — Forest road conditions and vehicle access
  - `seasonal-planning-guide.md` — Month-by-month NC camping guide
  - `water-and-connectivity.md` — Water sources + cell/Starlink coverage
  - `RESEARCH-PROMPT.md` — Gemini Deep Research prompt templates (not for ingestion)
- `data/pdfs/` — PDF corpus for ingestion
  - `black-mountain-trails-campground.pdf` — Black Mountain trails + campground map
  - `asheville-western-nc-hikes.pdf` — Asheville & Western NC Hikes guide
  - `backpackers-handbook-townsend.pdf` — Backpacker's Handbook 3rd ed. (general reference)
  - `wunc-nc-state-parks-guide.pdf` — WUNC NC State Parks guide

### Decisions Made
- **Vectra over sqlite-vec** — sqlite-vec is alpha and incompatible with Prisma; Vectra is zero-dep JSON-file store, clean swap to pgvector when deploying to Vercel
- **OpenAI for embeddings, Claude for chat** — two API keys needed; OpenAI embeddings are $0.02/M tokens, entire corpus under $1
- **Hybrid retrieval** — 0.7 semantic + 0.3 keyword weighting; FTS5 catches exact campground names and regulation numbers that semantic search misses
- **Gemini Deep Research for initial corpus** — structured markdown output, ingests same as PDFs; all citation artifacts stripped on import
- **800-token chunks, 100-token overlap** — balances coherent context vs. embedding dilution for camping reference content
- **`data/vectors/` gitignored** — Vectra JSON index files are local-only

### Status at End of Session
- Knowledge base corpus complete and ready to ingest
- Architecture documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Next build session: schema migration + deps + FTS5 table + Vectra setup (small task), then chunking/embedding utilities
